The "six things" (variables, functions, conditionals, arrays, loops, objects): Loops were used to reapeat the function so that a new password could be made each time. I used variables, for example to define a reset button. I used different functions to create the setup, build the 'here is yur password' phrase, to draw. I used conditionals to create the password.

Revisions made: Some revisions I made were the colors and adding a box around the generated password to make it stand out. I also made it so all the text aligned. Finally, I added a reset button that generates a new password when pressed.

Things you know now that you didn't the first time: I did not really understand how the "six things" were used or how the data from the word list was used to create the passwords. I also did not understand the first time how many stylistic design things like color and spacing worked.
